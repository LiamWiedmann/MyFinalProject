So far, I have successfuly gotten the ball rolling on what I want at a basic level. The requirements I had for this project are all there and mostly mapped out, now I just need to find a convenient way to code the rest of the pitches in a similar manner, without being redundant. In addition, I can't get pitches to play for some reason, which is extremely important for this project. What I also really want to work on is how the overall look of the website is, making sure spacing is formatted nicely, color schemes are good, and the website is overall an exciting tool for musicians to use. 
4/21 Definitely a lot more improved from last week. I added the rest of the tunings, figured out how to get the website to make sound, adjusted font sizes and formatted the page to be more visually appealing, added a background color, and am a lot happier with how the project is now. Going forward, I am going to figure out how to get a note to play indefinitely til a new note is selected, and try to format the page even better, ideally so everything is completely aligned vertically, rather than having a few sections per page.
